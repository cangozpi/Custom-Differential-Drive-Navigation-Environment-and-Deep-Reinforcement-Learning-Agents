render_mode: ['draw_coordinates'] # specifies which sensory informations to visualize. Currently supports ["no_render", "show_depth_camera_img_raw", "draw_coordinates"]. Corresponds to entries specified in ForkliftEnv.metadata['render_modes'] for more information.
step_duration: 1_000_000_000 # 50_000_000 # specifies the duration of each step() with respect to simulation time in nanoseconds (e.g. 1 second is 1_000_000_000).
real_time: False # if True than simulation is run in real time
