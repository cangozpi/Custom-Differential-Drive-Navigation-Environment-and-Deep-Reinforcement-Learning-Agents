log_full_detail: False # if True, logs a more detailed information to tensorboard.

# DiffDrive Environment Specific Parameters
distance_threshold: 0.1 # if robot is withing the reach of target smaller than this threshold value then goal state is reached
render_mode: ['no_render'] # specifies which sensory informations to visualize. Currently supports ["no_render", "draw_coordinates"]. Corresponds to entries specified in ForkliftEnv.metadata['render_modes'] for more information.
step_duration: 50_000_000 # specifies the duration of each step() with respect to simulation time in nanoseconds (e.g. 1 second is 1_000_000_000).
real_time: False # if True than simulation is run in real time
